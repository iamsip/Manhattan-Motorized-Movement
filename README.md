Overview:
This repository contains a MATLAB function that simulates the Manhattan movement model, which is a popular mobility model typically used to represent the movement of mobile nodes in urban areas.

Function Description:
manhattan(position, rxHeight)

This function generates a Manhattan movement model for a given node. The movement is based on typical vehicle speeds in an urban environment, with turns being made at right angles to represent the grid-like structure of roads in a Manhattan-style city layout.

Inputs:
position: A structure that contains the current position, distance traveled in the current direction, and other parameters necessary for the mobility model.

rxHeight: The height of the receiving node or device.

Outputs:
position: An updated structure that contains the new position after the movement, the total distance traveled in the current direction, and other updated parameters.

Usage:
Make sure you have the myPackageConstant function or package that provides necessary constants for the movement model.

Call the manhattan function with the required inputs.
